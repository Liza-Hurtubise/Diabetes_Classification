Analysis conducted: 
 
Logistic regression; plotting correlation between variables with a heatmap; determined model precision, accuracy, and recall; plotted a receiver operating       characteristic (ROC curve) to evaluate the model, calculated odds ratio for all explanatory variables and interpreted results.
